<h2>RiceApps Product Requirement Documents</h2>
<p>Welcome! This site serves to consolidate each project's Product Requirement Document (PRD)
    and increase transparency across teams. Feel free to explore and follow the progress of each team.
    The git repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/rice-apps/Project-PRDs.git">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Each PRD is meant to establish a clear understanding of each project's scope and communicate a shared vision for each project.
    It should be in constant revision as each team goes through different iterations and prototype. There is a recommended
    guide for each PRD; however, feel free to be creative to include mockups, wireframes, storyboards, etc in your PRD
    page!
</p>
<p>Couple of things to keep in mind when designing your PRD page:
    <ol>
        <li>Keep things concise</li>
        <li>Bullet points/tables/graphs are recommended but not necessary</li>
        <li>Don't edit on other team's html file</li>
    </ol>
</p>
