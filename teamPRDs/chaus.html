    <h1>Coffee House Scheduler </h1>
    <h4>Overview:</h4>
    <p>KOCs (Keepers of Coffee, AKA baristas) are scheduled at the beginning of each semester to work certain shifts every week.
        A google survey is sent out to everyone to fill out their availability for the semester as well as other relevant information
        such as who they prefer to work with. All information is kept and stored in multiple different google worksheets.
    </p>
    <h5>The Current Coffeehouse Scheduling Process</h5>
    <p>
        <ul>Timeline
            <li>December: The manager sends out a google form to all employees to fill out indicating when they
            are available on every shift of the week. Employees list their availability from 1-4, with 1 being the most
            available. The manager then process this data manually and enters all of it into multiple Google Sheets,
            each listing different information such as daily availability and hours worked. This process can take
            approximately 10-12 hours. Then, employees email each other for shift trade requests, and then if a trade
            is agreed upon, a Google Form is filled out specifying the details of the trade to inform the manager. </li>
        <li>January: Permanent and temporary trades continue, as the manager continues to modify the schedule based on
        these updated requests.</li>
        <br>

    </ul>
    <ol style="font-size: 18px">Steps to Create Master Schedule

            <li>
                Fill Tuesday/Thursday 9-11 am slot
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill Monday/Wednesday/Friday 9-11 am slot
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill closing shifts (they are low demand)
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill opening shifts (they are high demand)
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill 1-5pm slots for all days
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill all remaining slots
            </li>
    </ol>

    <br>
    <ul>Trade Details
        <li>
            Google form is used for employees to specify slots traded, employees trading, and whether the change
            is permanent or temporary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Manager then manually calculates the change in the net work hours for the employees who traded.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the case of a temporary change, the schedule itself is not changed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Part 1: Problem and User
        <h4>Problem: The current Rice Coffeehouse shift scheduling and trading system is time-consuming, unintuitive,
            and prone to human error.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
              Currently, when scheduling, the coffeehouse manager must navigate between a large number of large,
                complicated Google Sheets and scan them for precise information.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each individual spreadsheet keeps track of a separate metric, such as the current schedule, employee
                    preferences for shift hours, and hours worked.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><img src="../src/img/screenshot.png"></p>
            <li>
                Copying the data requires the manager to extract raw data and perform conditional formatting before
                inserting it into a new sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                It thus becomes difficult for the manager to look over the current data and check for potential mistakes.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A wrong spelling of name, for example, will result in that employees hours not being tracked.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                The current scheduling system also, does not handle special circumstances well, which can also lead to
                errors.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If an employee is scheduled for a shift from 5-7, that will mean they will not have enough time
                    to eat dinner at the Rice dining halls. The current system would do nothing to alert the manager
                    about this mistake.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Every incoming Coffeehouse scheduling manager must take a great deal of time to understand the
                current complex scheduling process.
            </li>

    <h3>Part 2: Product Specification</h3>
        <h4>Features: </h4>
        <ol style="font-size: 20px">
            <li>
                Manager Can Create the Overall Schedule
            </li>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Manager will see a week-long calendar schedule in which each day is split up into multiple buttons,
                    each labeled by a particular time, representing a shift. Each button can be clicked, bringing up a
                    modal screen in which the manager can see a list of currently scheduled and available coffeehouse
                    employees. The manager will be able to add / remove employees from the selected shift. When an
                    employee is added to the shift, they will disappear from the list of available employees.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each button in the week calendar view will have a color, representing how full that shift is.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The application will keep track of the amount of hours the employees are scheduled for. The manager
                    will receive a visual warning on the screen in the form of a popup if they attempt to schedule the
                    employee for more hours than the set limit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The application will also send the manager a warning if they attempt to schedule an employee for two,
                    non-consecutive shifts during the same day.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <li> Employees Can View the Coffeehouse Schedule
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        One view will allow employees to see their own, individual schedule for the current week.
                        This will be similar to the view of the manager, except they will not have the ability to edit
                        in this view.
                    </li>
                    <li>Another view will allow them to see the overall, master schedule. This will be the same
                    as the master schedule the manager sees but once again without editing functionality.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> Employees Can Trade Shifts With Other Employees</li>
            <ol>
                <li>The application will replace the current Google Form used for submitting trade requests.
                Now, this new online form on the application will automatically process the request, and update
                the user's shift in the schedule, as well as the two employees' total hours. </li>
            </ol>
        </ol>

            </li>
            <li>
                Manager will have the ability to edit the master schedule. They will see a list of available/already booked
                employees when they click on a particular shift and can add/remove employees.
            </li>
            <li>
                Managers will receive a warning if they attempt to schedule an employee that is listed as unavailable for
                that specific slot or if they attempt to book an employee for more than one consecutiveshift for one day.
            </li>
            <li>
                A trading mechanism will allow employees to exchange shifts. This will be a form that will automatically
                process the trade in the backend, updating the employees' availability and their total hours booked
                for that week.
            </li>
            <li>
                The backend of the application will keep track of the total number of hours each employee has worked.
            </li>
            <li>
                Elastic Search will be implemented to our databases in order to allow for a more robust and efficient
                way to look through and process data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Friday at 5pm, the hours for each employee in the backend will reset, and the display will change to show
                the next weeks employee availabilities.
